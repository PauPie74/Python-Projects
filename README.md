## CIPHER DENcoder
>June 2021

An encrypting and decrypting program. It supports following ciphers:
* Morse code

* Affine cipher
* URL code

The text can be opened from a file or typed directly into the console, after choosing option in the menu, the file will be saved with a name given by the user.
Found issues:
* Morse code does not decrypt correclty when more spaces are added between words
* During the decryption of affine cipher, the user has to input the a and b value

#### Fiction versus Nonfiction: The linguistic analysis of "The Wreck of the Titan" and "A Night to Remember"
> June 2021

An essay created with Jupyter Notebook. It is a linguistic analysis of two texts, in both of them the common feature is that there is a ship which sunk.
One text is a literary fiction (*"The Wreck of the Titan"*) and the other is a non-fiction (*"A Night to Remember"*).

## Training

Various .py files that were created as a result of my training. Most of them contain code realted to a specific module based on online tutorials. They do not aim to be more than just a training so an execution of a code can produce absurd results. It is like a **playground**.
